# Fast_API
Some the projects which I am doing to learn Fast API

### How to choose the location ?

For suppose C:/abc/dd.py is the file, then

1. Go to command prompt
2. type cd "C:/abc"
3. uvicorn dd:app --reload
4. Copy past the "http://127.0.0.1:8000" into the browser and then see the results

If you want are working as a frontend dev and want to explore how this api is working
